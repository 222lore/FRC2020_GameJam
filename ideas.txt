challenging coop puzzle game
mechanics that limit progress until other completes it
- both must progress at same time
- timed/performance of own side
- performance boosts
- competition but power ups that give unique advantages

** competition against self/others (beat ghosts?) **
- platformer (get to other side) that is timed
- battleblock theater? ability to throw other player across gap
- time is rewarded as money for upgrades
- must play through level together
- competition but power ups that give unique advantages
** **

the other person does what you do
both people control a doll at the same time
- super meat boy but controlled by two
- surgeon simulator with two person hands

** something that helps you now vs later **
rogue legacy but choose between current generation and lineage
invest in current or later self
- complete levels that require irreversible actions that will affect you later
- talk to npcs --> that interaction affects future interactions
- interactions/effects are seen by yourself (as a new traveller passing through)
- talk to NPC, later become that NPC and witness that reaction (somehow encourage player to say what the NPC said the first time)
- if you choose something different from what the NPC said the first time, your player changes in a new way
- multiple different accounts of the same thing, ending in a changed player
- more developed mindset
** **

SCOPE IDEAS:
one word answers / actions?
level -> NPC -> level w/ effects

** get points for helping teammate **
results/performance is opponent's score
- two difference scores -- must maximise your own to win but forces other person's score
** **

each person has same tasks but also separate secret tasks that could be sabotaged
- both are trying to reach place / get an amount of items
- but are trying to do own tasks too
- guess what other person is doing
